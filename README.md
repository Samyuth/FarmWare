# FarmWare

This project is essentially an open source library for use in IoT devices to moniter data for farmers for various conditions like rainfall, water quality, wind speed, temperature and so on. Essentially it would ofer the ability to create a unified panel to moniter all the different devices.

## Buisness model

The buisness model would lie in installation and maintenence of the technology. This would work out because there is a reasonable demand for the technology and end users are probably not tech savvy enough to set up all of the different components. It would also be possible to sell the installation and maintences services with the actual IoT devices in various bundles

## License

The license for this project is LGPL because generally any extensions or modifications should remain free and open however if this library is used to as a part of a larger product it would not make sense to restrict contributers.
